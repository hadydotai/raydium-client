# Raydium Client

Raydium client is a small CLI application to interact with Raydium, specifically
around swapping between tokens using Raydium's CPMM/CP-Swap pools.

It integrates directly with Raydium using only the blockchain, no API
frivolities. It can operate in two modes, interactive and non-interactive. By
default it's interactive (a mini TUI), but can be driven purely by flags on the
CLI.
